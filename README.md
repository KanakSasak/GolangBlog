# GolangBlog
I'm trying to build a simple blog in Go (golang) to practice the language and eventually create a (video) tutorial.

For now, you can add/edit, posts/categories. I use MySQL as my Database. 
You can insert your own host/user/password adn port in the config file.

It uses TinyMCE so you can do basic mark-up for your blog posts. 

Near Future objectives:

- Removing to trash, Delete posts/categories
- User login (admin area)
